Problem :

Your tests fail sometimes in CI (Continuous Integration) — meaning:

It’s not code failure, but test instability (flaky tests).

The main causes could be:
🧱 Selectors breaking,
🧪 State contamination (session re-use issues), or
🔍 Lack of observability (you can’t tell what happened).


🍳 Analogy

Think of your Playwright tests as a restaurant kitchen:

Refactor selectors = label your ingredients properly (“salt” vs “white powder”).

Isolate state = each chef uses their own cutting board (no contamination).

Enhance observability = install CCTV cameras (trace/screenshot).

👉 Together, they make your kitchen (CI) both fast and clean.
